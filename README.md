# Fallout Terminal
A simple terminal, styled like Bethesda's Fallout consoles.

Run javascript code directly in the console or from external files, do simple math, or simply type. Terminal commands must be preceded by a colon and local variables must be surrounded by the modulo when called.

Note: Local variables can store basic variables and arrays, but not objects or functions.
